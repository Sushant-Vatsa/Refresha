## 📖 About The Project

**Refresha** is a front-end web development project demonstrating how to build a high-performance, visually engaging landing page without the use of heavy frameworks. 

The design focuses on the **Glassmorphism** trend—utilizing translucency, blur effects, and vibrant gradients to create a sense of depth. The functional aspects are built entirely with **Vanilla JavaScript**, featuring dynamic DOM manipulation, state management for a shopping cart, and custom animations.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Modern UI/UX:**
    * **Glassmorphism:** Frosted glass panels using `backdrop-filter` and semi-transparent borders.
    * **Parallax Background:** Floating icons that move at different speeds relative to the scroll position.
    * **CSS Animations:** Smooth fade-ins, hover effects, and a custom "add to cart" flying animation.
* **Interactive Product Grid:**
    * **Category Filtering:** Instantly filter products (Cola, Fruit, Zero Sugar) without page reloads.
    * **Dynamic Rendering:** Product cards are generated via JavaScript objects, making the inventory easy to scale.
* **Functionality:**
    * **Shopping Cart Logic:** Cart count persists using `localStorage`.
    * **Product Modals:** Detailed popup views with nutrition facts and pricing.
    * **Image Lightbox:** A custom-built gallery viewer for lifestyle images.
* **Fully Responsive:** optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with a custom hamburger menu.
